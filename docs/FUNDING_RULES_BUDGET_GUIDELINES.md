## FUNDING FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

### Funding Philosophy:
- **Lump Sum Approach**: Fixed amounts based on project scope and partnership type
- **Simplification**: Reduced administrative burden compared to actual cost reporting
- **Co-financing Principle**: Projects must demonstrate additional resource contribution
- **Performance-Based**: Full payment contingent on satisfactory completion
- **Transparency**: Clear rules and predictable funding amounts

### Key Principles:
- **Non-retroactivity**: Activities must start after grant agreement signature
- **Co-financing Requirement**: Beneficiaries must contribute additional resources
- **No-profit Principle**: Grants cannot generate profit (except for unit costs/lump sums)
- **Non-cumulative Award**: No double funding from EU sources
- **Proportionality**: Activities must be proportional to grant amount
